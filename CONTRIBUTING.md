Since Di√°rio Oficial seeks to become a trustful source of official governmental announcements, every data source must also be trustful. A private company publishing government gazettes without official permission, for instance, is not a trustful source.

## Automated Testing

The project is backed with a test suite, which can be run with a single command.

```
$ make test
```
